1. Finished the command line utilities part.

2. Finished the Add something new part(a). By default the girl stands still, if we click the 
mouse, the boy will move toward the click point, here the camera focus on the boy. If we click
the boy icon, the icon will switch to the girl icon, and now we can control the girl with our
mouse, here the camera will focus on the girl. By clicking back on the icon again, the control
will switch back to the boy as well. 

3. Finished the Add something new part(b). The bees can move randonly around the board. If a 
bee is too close (this distance is predefined as a threshold) to the girl, the bee will ran 
away from the girl. The attack action also has been implemented in the bee.py file. When a bee
 is close to the girl, it will attack her.

Extra functionalities:
1. If a bee is too close to the boy, the boy will kick it, and the bee will fall down. (code is 
implemented in bee.py file)

2. After bees fall down, the beekeeper will come to the position where the bees falling down, to
ckeck if bees are really dead. The default action of the beekeeper is just stand 
still. (code is in the bee.py file)

3. Create a tourist_male2.py file. Due to the fact that he needs a guide, the tourist_male2 will 
run after the hero. I also have implement other actions of the tourist_male2, such as run(), 
standstill().

4. Create a hippie_priest.py file, which will the actions of the hippie_priest. First, he will walk
randomly around the board, we will compute the distance between him and the girl iteratively, if he
is close to the girl, he will read a story to hear, or just fall to the ground as a jok.
